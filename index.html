        The Pokémon franchise revolves around 913 (with more to come in future games) fictional species of collectible monsters, each having unique designs, skills, and powers. Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon are fictional creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon World. The designs for the multitude of species can draw inspiration from anything such as animals, plants, and mythological creatures. Many Pokémon are capable of evolving into more powerful species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results. Originally, only a handful of artists led by Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon. However, by 2013 a team of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous fictional creatures.

The vast array of creatures is commonly divided into "Generations", with each division primarily encompassing new titles in the main video game series and often a change of handheld platform. Generation I refers to Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow; Generation II refers to Gold, Silver, and Crystal; Generation III refers to Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald; Generation IV refers to Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver; Generation V refers to Black, White, Black 2, and White 2; Generation VI refers to X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire; Generation VII refers to Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon, Let's Go, Pikachu!, and Let's Go, Eevee!; Generation VIII refers to Sword, Shield, Brilliant Diamond, Shining Pearl, and Legends: Arceus; and Generation IX refers to Scarlet and Violet. Each Generation is also marked by the addition of new Pokémon: 151 in Generation I in the Kanto region, 100 in Generation II in the Johto region, 135 in Generation III in the Hoenn region, 107 in Generation IV in the Sinnoh region, 156 in Generation V in the Unova region, 72 in Generation VI in the Kalos region, 88 in Generation VII in the Alola and Kanto regions, 96 in Generation VIII in the Galar and Hisui regions, and at least 8 in Generation IX.[1]

Due to the large number of Pokémon, listing of each species is divided into articles by generation. The 913 Pokémon are organized by their number in the National Pokédex—an in-game electronic encyclopedia that provides various information on Pokémon. The National Pokédex is subdivided into regional Pokédex series, each revolving around species introduced at the time of their respective generations along with older generations. For example, the Johto Pokédex, Generation II, covers the 100 species introduced in Gold and Silver in addition to the original 151 species. The encyclopedias follow a general ordering: starter Pokémon are listed first, followed by species obtainable early in the respective games, and are concluded with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon. Generation V is a notable exception, as Victini is the first Pokémon in the Unova Pokédex.

  <span>Ash Ketchum's last name is a play on "catch 'em" after the show's tagline, "gotta catch 'em all." The name Ash means "happy," reflecting Ash's persistent, optimistic, and sometimes overly-confident personality.

    Ash's Japanese name is Satoshi, named after the creator of Pokémon himself, Satoshi Tajiri. The name Satoshi means "intelligent," which does not reflect Ash's personality at all. Ash is not very similar to Satoshi Tajiri, as they have different favorite Pokémon and Ash is much more childish, but instead of making his name match his personality, Ash was named this way as a nice homage to the franchise's creator.</span>

        Misty literally means "covered with mist," which is appropriate for a Water-type gym leader, as mist is water droplets that have evaporated into the air. Misty's Japanese name is Kasumi, which means "mist."
        It is hinted in some episodes that Misty's last name is Waterflower, for example, the season 1 episode The Waterflowers Of Cerulean City features Misty's sisters, the Waterflowers. If this is true, the surname would also match Misty's love for Water-types.

    <span>
        One of the most lovable characters in the show, Brock has a name that is a play on the word "rock," as he starts as a Rock-type gym leader. However, the name Brock also means "badger-like" in Old English. His Japanese name Takeshi means "strong" or "warrior," also playing on the rock attributes. 
        Brock acts as an older brother to the group and is often the wisest, but his sturdy personality is easily shaken by his many crushes on beautiful women such as Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny. According to voice actor Eric Stuart, Brock's last name is Harrison. Harrison means "son of Harry" and Harry means "leader," tying the name into Brock's older brother role in the group.

  <span>May is the fifth month, appropriate for the fifth human main character to feature in the show. May is introduced after Ash, Misty, Brock, and Tracey, but before Max her younger brother.
    May's Japanese name is Haruka. Haru means "spring" in Japanese, and combined with "ka" means "spring flower." The name indicates a change of companions and locations for Ash, as spring brings new life just as May brought a new perspective and role to the show. May's flowery name also references the fact that she is the eldest child of the Petalburg City Gym Leader, and reflects her optimistic personality.
